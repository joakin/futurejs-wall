FutureJS wall
=============

A small clojurescript canvas project for the workshop "diving into
clojurescript" of FutureJS

```
lein cljsbuild auto
```

Open lighttable and a browser tab, and connect to it to eval and play with the
code.

The different versions of the code are stored in tags.

To access a version do:

```
git tags -l # to see the tags
git show <tagname> # to see what a particular tag is about
git checkout tags/<tagname> # to change the working copy to that tag
```
